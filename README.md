# Balance_Sheet_Calc.
This piece of code was an experiment to see whether I could get to grips with how functions and different files worked within python.
I decided to write an accounting ratios calculator as a large part of one of my university modules was to calculate exactly that and felt like this would be of use to me within the module and beyond.
I have not yet been able to figure out how to read a PDF document with this code, however it works perfectly with xlsx files which was how the balance sheets were presented to me during the module.
Not all the ratios are included as the main premise of the project is there and would be easy to write in a few extra lines to find the appropriate figures.
